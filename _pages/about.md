Hello, I’m Youngha Chun, an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at KAIST.

My current interests are in systems that connect hardware and software. Recently, I’ve worked on hands-on and studied performance topics in storage and I/O systems under [Prof. Myungsoo Jung (CAMELAB)](https://camelab.org/) (e.g., SSD behavior and file-system effects).
